# John the Ripper – Password Cracking Lab

## Overview
This project demonstrates practical password cracking using **John the Ripper** in a Linux (Ubuntu on WSL) environment.  
The objective is to show hands‑on understanding of password security, hash formats, and cracking methodologies.

---

## Tools & Environment
- **Tool:** John the Ripper
- **OS:** Ubuntu Linux (WSL)
- **Attack Type:** Wordlist attack

---

## Hash Information
- **Hash Type:** MD5 (md5crypt)
- **Source:** Self‑created hash for educational purposes

---

## Methodology
1. Created and verified an MD5 password hash
2. Loaded the hash into John the Ripper
3. Tested incremental (brute‑force) mode
4. Performed a **wordlist attack** using `rockyou.txt`
5. Successfully recovered the plaintext password

---

## Screenshots
Screenshots are provided to demonstrate correct command usage and successful password cracking.

- Hash file verification  
- John the Ripper running with wordlist  
- Successfully cracked password output  


---

## Result
Password was successfully cracked using John the Ripper.

---

## Ethical Notice
This lab was conducted **only on self‑generated hashes** in a controlled environment for learning purposes.  
No unauthorized systems or real user data were involved.

---

## Key Learnings
- Importance of strong passwords
- Real‑world effectiveness of wordlist attacks
- Practical use of John the Ripper on Linux
- Troubleshooting in restricted environments (WSL)
